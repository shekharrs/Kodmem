        😂 Oh man, ever stare at your own React hook three days later like "Who wrote this garbage?" or spend 20 minutes re-Googling that TypeScript generic you swore you nailed yesterday? Yeah, us too. Every dev's dirty little secret: we learn fast, forget faster.<br/>
        Kodmem's the sassy sidekick that calls BS on your leaky brain. Toss in those cursed "why do I always forget this?" moments—React patterns that ghost you, auth flows from hell, Mongo queries that play hide-and-seek. We morph 'em into ninja prompts: "Recall this WITHOUT peeking, hotshot!" (active recall does the dirty work), then hit you with spaced repetition timing so perfect it's basically witchcraft.<br/>
        Five minutes daily → suddenly you're remembering your own damn code. Retention graphs going 💀→🚀. Laugh at Future You not panic-debugging the same bugs. Built by a dev who was basically writing hate mail to his own memory.<br/>
        Join the "I actually know my stack" rebels. *Join the waitlist* → be first to remember what you learn. Your brain will thank you (eventually).<br/>
        Best regards (and a high-five),<br/>
